            <h3 class="P1-30">Trends of the 30s and 40s</h3>
            <h3 class="P2-30">
                Due to the economic depression and WW2 there was limited money for women to spend on luxurious clothes
                and accessories. Therefore trends from the 30s/40s were relatively quite similar. Fashion focused more
                on body defined dresses, a marked waist, and calf-length hemlines, focusing on the feminine figure to
                create elegance and sophistication. Shoulders were accentuated with padding and short puffed sleeves to
                create an inverted triangle appearance of the top half of the body. As women helped with the war effort
                by working in factories and other male dominated jobs in that era, fashion needed to adapt to
                functionality. Therefore high waisted, flare trousers became quite popular as well as tailored suits and
                blouses tucked into skirts. During the evening women would wear backless, floor length dresses often
                made of shiny materials such as of silk. With short or no sleeves, these dresses were designed to
                emphasise women's curves.</h3>

            <h3 class="P2-30">
                Fashion was mainly dictated by rationing coupons , with each type of clothing valued by 'points'. With
                only 66 coupons a year per adult, with this number decreasing as the war progressed. The 'Make Do and
                Mend' campaign was launched to encourage people to make their clothes last longer. With limiting coupons
                the ability to repair, renovate and make clothes became really important. <br> <br>

        <h3 class="P1-30">Women and the war effort</h3>
        <h3 class="P2-30">
            More than six million women took wartime jobs in factories, three million volunteered with the Red Cross,
            and over 200,000 served in the military. Women “became proficient cooks and housekeepers, managed the
            finances, learned to fix the car, worked in a defence plant, and wrote letters to their soldier husbands
            that were consistently upbeat.” Stephen Ambrose.
