            <h3 id="P1-20">Trends of the 20s</h3>
            <h3 id="P2-20"> The prohibition in the US, along with the emerge of feminism and independence
               for women inspired fashion designs with comfort, practicality and style in mind. Women no longer wanted
               to wear corsets and constricting long dresses. Instead they opted for 'Flapper Fashion' a style that is
               still well known a century later. Consisting of looser dresses with knee length hemlines and a dropped
               waistline, creating a 'boyish looking figure'. The dresses would have a variety of embellishments
               including beading, fringes and feathers. Paired with heavier and darker makeup, accessories and many
               women also adopted a short bob haircut.</h3>
