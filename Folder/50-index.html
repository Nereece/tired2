                    <h3 class="P1-50"> Trends of the 50s</h3>
                    <h3 class="P2-50"> The trend that dominated this decade was given the name 'New Look'. Designed by
                        Christian Dior, this trend was the complete opposite to what women wore in the 40s. As the war
                        was over expensive materials were being used again to design a look similar to the
                        mid-nineteenth century. With women having to wear boned corsets, bust and hip pads to create the
                        perfect hourglass figure. Although it was acceptable for women to wear casual clothing at home,
                        they were expected to look perfect in public and when their husbands arrived home from work.
                        This look consisted of huge skirts at mid-calf length with softer shoulders, unlike the padding
                        used during the 40s. Women's appearances were linked to how successful their husbands were even
                        if they weren't well off women were pressured to appear this way. By having expensive dresses
                        with accessories that all matched perfectly with their outfits.</h3>

                    <h3 class="P2-50"> Many women were outraged, especially in the United States. Protests were held
                        targeting Dior and his new clothing. Women had just gained a large amount of equality and
                        weren’t ready to give it up — both in work and in fashion. The new clothes used excessive
                        amounts of fabric, needed constant maintenance, and required a complete coordinated accessory
                        collection to be “perfect.” However, after the hardships of the war, everybody was ready for a
                        change, and by the start of the ‘50s, everybody was wearing the New Look. <br> <br> Coco Chanel
                        disliked the ‘New Look’ so much that she reopened her business after closing it at the start
                        of the war. In 1954, she came back with slim suits – the brand’s signature look – in wools and
                        tweeds.
                        Jackets were boxy with no collar, and skirts were straight and comfortable. She topped the look
                        off with
                        costume jewellery and the famous quilted bag.</h3>
